                    <h2>What We Know (and What We Desperately Hope) Will Happen in Dune: Part Three</h2>
                    <p>
                        By splitting Frank Herbert’s Dune into two parts, Denis Villeneuve pulled a bait and switch with
                        audience expectations. In the first film, you can view Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides as a
                        fairly typical “chosen one” hero, but by the end of Part Two, the tide has turned. Paul embraces
                        his destiny as the figurehead of a holy war, foreshadowing a catastrophic rise to power. In the
                        as-yet unfilmed Dune: Part Three, Paul’s life is set to take an even darker turn, with
                        Villeneuve announcing plans to adapt the epic Dune Messiah.

                        They say their call follows a new insight gained into black holes as a result of producing the
                        visual effects for the Hollywood film.
                        Experts have also confirmed that the portrayal of "wormholes" is scientifically accurate.
                        Scientific papers have been published in the American Journal of Physics and in Classical and
                        Quantum Gravity.
                        Dr David Jackson, who printed one of the papers in this month's AJP,, external said "publishing
                        this paper was a no-brainer".
                        He added: "The physics has been very carefully reviewed by experts and found to be accurate. The
                        publication will encourage physics teachers to show the film in their classes to get across
                        ideas about general relativity."

                        The unveiling of an actor in costume as Superman is a rare affair, akin to the first look at a
                        new James Bond. Only three men have starred as the character in its nearly 50-year big screen
